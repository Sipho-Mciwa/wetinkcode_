# Problem - Word Processor

The word processing program offers functionality that helps determine linguistic complexity.

### The expected features includes:

* transform all the words to a list of lowercase strings for further processing
* determine all the words of longer than a specified length, in order to get a degree of complexity of the text
* determine the spread of word lengths (i.e. how many words of each length appears)
* count how many times each alphabet character appears in a list of words

### To Run

* `python3 word_processor.py`
* follow the input prompts to get the desired output

### To Test

* To run all the unittests: `python3 -m unittest tests/test_main.py`
* To run a specific step's unittest, e.g step *1*: `python3 -m unittest tests.test_main.MyTestCase.test_step1`
* _Note_: at the minimum, these (*unedited*) tests must succeed before you may submit the solution for review.
